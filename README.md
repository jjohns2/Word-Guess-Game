### About
This project was a first time attempt of using javascript to create a game. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript were used to complete this project.

### Theme
The theme is a take on a start menu from classic fantasy 8-bit RPG game. More specifically, it is from the first final fantasy games that were created from 1987 to 1994. The words are reoccuring themes in the games, so they will provide a challenge if you are unfamiliar with the game series itself.
